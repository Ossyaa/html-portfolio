<h1>The Best Movies According to Elizabeth</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
   <hr>
   <h3>La La Land</h3>
    <p>A musical drama about the hardships of a relationship that 
   falls apart due to individual life goals not lining up at the 
   right time.</p>
   <h3>The Lion King</h3>
   <p>Someone out there thought to themselves, "Hamlet would be really cool
    if all of the characters were lions." and made it happen, and I think that is 
    marvelous.
   </p>
   <h3>About Time</h3>
   <p>A romantic tragic comedy about a family whose sons can travel
        back in time by going into a closet. This movie tells the 
        story of a son and his father, and the tragic consequences 
        of knowing you can go in the past to visit your former self,
         and what changing the future can do to not only the 
         individual, but the family as a whole. </p>
